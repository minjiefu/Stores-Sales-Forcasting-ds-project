# Title
Walmart Stores Sales Forcasting

# Purpose
This project aims to construct a‬‭ predictive‬‭ model‬‭ capable‬‭ of‬‭ forecasting‬‭ future‬‭ weekly‬‭ sales‬ ‭ for‬‭ individual‬‭ departments‬‭ within‬‭ 45‬‭ Walmart‬‭ stores based on‬‭ historical‬ ‭weekly sales data.‬ ‭As‬‭ shown‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ weekly‬‭ sales‬‭ data,‬‭ the‬‭ trends‬‭ for‬‭ a‬‭ department‬‭ across‬‭ different‬ stores‬‭ appear‬‭ consistent.‬‭ In‬‭ order‬‭ to‬‭ diminish‬‭ noise,‬‭ Singular‬‭ Value‬‭ Decomposition‬(SVD) was employed to pre-process train data.‬ The performance of the model (evaluated by Weighted Mean Absolute Error) reached 1589.75.
